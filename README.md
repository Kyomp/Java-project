# Java-project, Hotel Management
On this project, we created an object-oriented hotel management system using Java programming language. The program enables management on a hotel's guests, staff, and room. It has 3 main menus to manage those 3 aspects:
- **Guest** menu features are adding and removing a guest, assigning a guest to a room, and adding service/room charges to the guest. The information displayed for the guests are the name, phone number, current room number, and total fees charges.
- The **staff** menu is able to add and remove staff to the list. The information displayed are name, phone number, staff id, and hourly wage
- The **room** menu is also able to add and remove rooms. The informations are room number, type, cost per night, and the guest name currently staying on a room

The list of guests, staffs, and rooms are stored in an arraylist and txt file. The arraylists serve as the reference of the lists for the methods/algorithm inside the program. It regularly loads data from text file and rewrites it whenever an update is performed, therefore the updates cycle and data is still preserved when program is closed and openned again.

We created a user interface using fxmls files with the help of SceneBuilder software. It enables better interaction with buttons and navigation and better list visualization

# Technology Used
**Java** - Used for our main program language (foundation) to make the entire application along with its algorithm.

**JavaFX** - a part of Java programming language that acts as a platform for developing interactive user interface for applications.

**Scene Builder** - a platform to design a user interface easily by using FXML files that enables UI creation separated from the logic of the application. We used this to easily create JavaFX layout and fasten the development of the app.

**CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used for styling and structuring an HTML/XML file. In our case, we used Scene Builder to make FXML files and CSS could be implemented to it.

**Encryption** - Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), for cryptography using hash functions, published by Americaâ€™s NSA. Used in encrypting our data files along with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

# Manual Guide
The user interface have 3 main buttons located in the left side of the interface: "Guest," "Staff," and "Management":

![mainmenu](https://github.com/Kyomp/Java-project/assets/91313923/8590a09d-9533-4441-839b-f6b950370a00)

If those buttons are clicked it will show each aspect's lists of objects (it will navigate to another window that has a list display that is shown in form of a box):

Each of them has an "add" button that will navigate to each aspect's add window to append the list with new data object.

The add staff menu has 4 fields to be filled/modified: Name, Phone Number, Staff ID, and Hourly Wage. Phone number format is the same as before.

Hourly wage has a minimum of 2000 and below that will show an error message.

The add room menu has 3 fields: Room Number, Type, and Cost per Night. If the room number is filled with a number that is taken by existing room, an error message will be shown
