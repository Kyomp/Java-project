# Java-project
On this project, we created an object-oriented hotel management system using Java programming language. The program enables management on a hotel's guests, staff, and room. It has 3 main menus to manage those 3 aspects:
    Guest menu features are adding and removing a guest, assigning a guest to a room, and adding service/room charges to the guest. The information displayed for the guests are the name, phone number, current room number, and total fees charges.
    The staff menu is able to add and remove staff to the list. The information displayed are name, phone number, staff id, and hourly wage
    The room menu is also able to add and remove rooms. The informations are room number, type, cost per night, and the guest name currently staying on a room
